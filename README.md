# Removing-noise-from-images-with-CNN

The aim of this project is to obtain clearer and higher quality images by reducing or eliminating unwanted noise in noisy images. This project aims to increase the usefulness of noisy images that can be used in various fields (e.g. medical imaging, photography, video processing). AI models use learned knowledge to reduce noise by recognizing patterns and structures in noisy images. This project focuses on improving noisy images to achieve better visual quality and more accurate analysis results.

 # Model: CNN(Convolutional Neural Network)

 The CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model used to remove noise in images has an architecture consisting of convolution layers and activation functions to produce clean images from noisy images. In the model where noisy images are given as input, features are extracted from the image with convolution layers and these features are processed using activation functions such as ReLU. The output layer recreates the clean image. The model is trained using loss functions such as Mean Square Error (MSE) or Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) on pairs of noisy and clean images and is optimized with optimization algorithms such as Adam. During the training process, the generalization ability of the model is increased with data augmentation techniques.
